# Detecting Contours of Human Organs in CT Images

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a program for detecting contours of human organs in CT images using the Canny edge detector. The project was developed as part of the **Biomedical Signal and Image Processing** course at the **University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science** in 2025.

## Project Description
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the effectiveness of the Canny edge detector in extracting anatomical structures from CT images. The algorithm was applied to images from the **CTMRI database**, developed by the **Laboratory for Biomedical Computer Systems and Imaging (LBCSI)** at the University of Ljubljana.

### Key Features
1. **Implementation of the Canny Edge Detector**: Developed from scratch in Python to detect organ contours in CT images.
2. **Performance Analysis**: Evaluating the effectiveness and limitations of the implemented algorithm on the CTMRI dataset.
3. **Comparison with OpenCV Implementation**: Benchmarking our custom implementation against the Canny edge detector provided by OpenCV.
4. **Proposed Enhancements**: Identifying and addressing weaknesses in the original implementation to improve detection accuracy.

## Repository Structure
- **`code.py`**: Python script implementing the Canny edge detection algorithm.
- **`report.pdf`**: A detailed report discussing the implementation, performance analysis, comparisons, and proposed enhancements.
